added comments and what seems to be a little extra code but no new methods

GBox:

cyclelist is a circular queue and a bunch of helper methods.
	Has push, pop, as well as Dump that returns everything in the queue.
	Dump could be used to print out to Firebug

	lets you add, read, and clear but there doesn't seem to be a remove method.
